# Portfolio Website Development Rules

## Component Naming
- **Components**: MUST use PascalCase (e.g., `HeroSection.tsx`, `ContactModal.tsx`)
- All React component files must be named in PascalCase

## Folder Naming
- **Folders**: MUST use kebab-case (e.g., `case-studies/`, `hero-section/`)
- All directory names must be in kebab-case format

## Magic UI Component Priority
- **Magic UI First**: Always check Magic UI (https://magicui.design) for existing components before creating custom ones
- Prefer using Magic UI components as base, then customize as needed
- If a Magic UI component exists for the use case, use it rather than building from scratch

## Motion and Animation Requirements
- **Motion-First**: Every interactive element MUST include intentional animations
- Use Framer Motion for all animations
- Store reusable animation variants in `lib/animations/motion-variants.ts`
- Support `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- All scroll-triggered animations must use intersection observer patterns
- Animations should guide attention and support storytelling

## Dark & Light Theme Rules
- **Theme-Aware**: All components MUST respect dark/light themes
- Use CSS variables for all colors (defined in `globals.css`)
- Never hardcode colors - always use theme variables
- Theme system uses `next-themes` with system preference detection
- Manual toggle must be available and stored in localStorage
- Smooth transitions between themes (CSS transitions)

## Content-Driven Architecture
- **No Hardcoded Copy**: All textual content MUST come from content files
- Text content should be loaded from JSON/MDX files in `content/` directory
- Use TypeScript interfaces for type-safe content loading
- Content files: `hero.json`, `metrics.json`, `skills.json`, `founders.json`, `site-settings.json`
- Case studies should use MDX format in `content/case-studies/`

## Accessibility
- All interactive elements must have proper ARIA labels
- Keyboard navigation must work for all interactive components
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure sufficient color contrast in both themes
- Support screen readers

## SEO
- Use proper meta tags in layout
- Implement structured data where appropriate
- Use semantic HTML markup
- Optimize images with alt text

## Performance
- Optimize images (use Next.js Image component)
- Code split appropriately
- Minimize bundle size
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components where appropriate

## Code Quality
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow React best practices (hooks, functional components)
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Extract utilities to appropriate `lib/` or `hooks/` directories
