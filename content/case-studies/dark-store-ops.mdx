# Scaling Dark Store Operations from 0 to 500+ Orders/Day

## Challenge

When I joined, the dark store operations were early-stage and fragile:
- No reliable fulfillment workflows
- Manual coordination across picking, packing, and dispatch
- SLA breaches due to bottlenecks
- Limited visibility into real-time operations

Scaling volume without breaking customer experience was the core challenge.

## Approach

I focused on building systems before scale:

1. **Mapped End-to-End Order Flow**: Identified choke points across fulfillment and dispatch
2. **Prioritized Using RICE**: Focused on highest-impact fixes first
3. **Built Internal Tooling**: WMS flows, picker–packer processes, escalation paths
4. **Operational Visibility**: Dashboards for live order status and bottlenecks
5. **Process Standardization**: SOPs to reduce variability during peak load

## Results

- **Scaled from first order to 500+ orders/day**
- **Significant improvement in SLA reliability**
- Reduced dependency on ad-hoc coordination
- Operations became predictable, measurable, and scalable

## Key Learnings

Fire-fighting isn’t chaos — it’s signal. The fastest way to scale is to identify the smallest bottleneck and systemize it before volume exposes it again.
