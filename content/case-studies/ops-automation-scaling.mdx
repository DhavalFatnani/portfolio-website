# Operational Automation & Internal Tooling

## Challenge

Operational teams were slowed down by repetitive manual tasks:
- Manual reporting and reconciliation
- Fragmented tools with no integration
- High error rates due to human dependency
- Limited visibility into operational health

This reduced speed and increased cognitive load on teams.

## Approach

I approached automation as a systems problem, not a tooling problem:

1. **Identified Repetitive High-Frequency Tasks**
2. **Designed Simple Automation Pipelines** to remove manual steps
3. **Built Dashboards** to surface operational health in real time
4. **Standardized Inputs & Outputs** to reduce variability
5. **Focused on Adoption**, not just implementation

## Results

- **~20% improvement in team productivity**
- Reduced manual errors across workflows
- Faster operational decision-making
- Teams spent more time solving real problems, not maintaining systems

## Key Learnings

Automation isn’t about writing code — it’s about removing unnecessary friction. The best automation quietly disappears into the workflow and gives teams breathing room.
